# MidJourney Bulk Imagine

## What is this tool?
This tool allows people to put a list of prompts and then will ask the midjourney bot to generate images for each of those prompts one by one

## What sets this apart from a basic macro?
The only distinct feature is that the script checks for the response message and if its an error it will try again in a few minutes to avoid skipping over prompts.

### I don't maintain this repo
